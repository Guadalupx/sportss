<h3>MENTAL HEALTH FOR YOUNG:
</h3>
<p>No one is immune to mental health challenges. Just as physical injuries require medical care, mental health issues can also impact performance and need attention. It is important to emphasize on the mind-body connection.
    Athletes face unique stressors that increase their risk for anxiety and depression, with up to 34% of elite athletes experiencing symptoms. Young athletes need to seek support and not face their struggles in silence, maintaining a healthy mental outlook.    
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>What affects athletes’ mental health?
</h2>
<p1>Anxiety and Pressure: Athletes face pressure from coaches, teammates, family, and fans, leading to performance anxiety. The constant drive to improve during training, adds to their stress, even when they perform well.
<br> Physical and Social Stress can lead to burnout, eating disorders from strict diets, depression during injury recovery and loneliness.
<br> Athletes spend about 40 hours per week on their sport, often alongside studies or work. Travel for competitions can lead to missing personal events or classes, and student-athletes may struggle financially.

<h2>How parents can help: </h2>
